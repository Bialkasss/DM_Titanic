Our main goal is to achieve better accuracy in classification.
We use the dataset provided in ***train.csv***, where 60% of the data is used for training our model and 40% for testing it. 
The final datasets, resulting from all the algorithms used in final_titanic.ipynb, are available in two files:
- ***train_dataset.csv***, containing two columns ('feature0' with the obtained values and 'Survived' with the correct predicted values).
- ***test_dataset.csv***, containing two columns ('feature0' with the obtained values and 'Predicted_Survived' with the values predicted by us).

For a more detailed analysis of the classification process, please refer to ***titanic.ipynb***. Additionally, further information can be found in ***info_about_updates.txt***.
A summary of our work is presented in ***Presentation.pdf.***
